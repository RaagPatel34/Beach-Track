## Update 1 (2/11/2025)

- The following must be installed before compiling your app:
- "npm install leaflet react-leaflet"
- "npm install mongoose"
- "npm install axios"
- "npm install react-toastify"
- "npm install @clerk/nextjs"

You will need to ask Roger for:
- The information held in the .env.local file (in order to use Clerk)
