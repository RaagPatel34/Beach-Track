# BeachTrack
## Update 1 (2/11/2025)
Currently merged our current working/done portions into one page. Keep in mind that in order to run any of these folder, create a next.js app first (ensure that it includes a "src") and then copy and paste these folder in the approriate location (ask question in the discord if you're confused). 
- The following must be installed before compiling your app:
- "npm install leaflet react-leaflet"
- "npm install mongoose"
- "npm install axios"
- "npm install react-toastify"
- "npm install @clerk/nextjs"
